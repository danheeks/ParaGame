# ParaGame
Using pymunk and pygame to experiment with paraglider physics

How about powering a paraglider by pulling the front and rear lines in and out to achieve flapping flight?
Here is a video of a simulation I have made in python ( video here https://youtu.be/JUDfeM4bNH4 ). The length of the front and rear lines are defined by 2 curves; lists of length positions for each frame of the simulation.  I am imagining winches mounted in front of the pilot powered by electric motors and batteries. It took me a lot of experimenting to find a pair of curves that would achieve climbing flight. There would be separate winches for the left and right sides. The steering and speed control would have to be done by the winches differing the lengths of each side a little controlled by the computer. So the pilot's input could be via a joystick or any other input. The advantage of this system over a convential powered paraglider would be that it could be made to be very quiet as there is no propeller. The risks associated with propellers would be removed, but probably replaced with a new set of risks!
